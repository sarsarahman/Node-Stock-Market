# Stock Portfolio

This is virtual stock market trading platform / stock tracker that's currently being built. Users will start with 100k USD to use on the stock market to test their wits against Wall Street.

## Usage

First clone this repository and run `npm install`, followed by `npm start` to start it up. After that, just enter a stock symbol, followed by spaces in between to pull data on multiple stocks at once. Have fun!

## Recent Updates

Functionality to query multiple stocks at once is in the works. For now the interface will be through the command line until more functionality is worked out. Integration to a PostgreSQL database and the construction of a data schema is now being worked on.

## Development

Any pull requests and comments are entirely welcome! It still needs quite a bit of setting up. First clone this repository, then run `npm install`, followed by `npm start` to get it running. A local instance of PostgreSQL is required to have this up and running along with a local PostgreSQL username and database name set up beforehand.

For PostgreSQL set up instructions with Knex.js, refer to http://knexjs.org/
