# Stock Portfolio

This is a project I'm working on that serves as a platform to build a stock market portfolio and keep track of your stocks. It's currently a work-in-progress. 

## Usage

First clone this repository and run `npm install`, follwed by `npm start` to start it up. After that, just enter a stock symbol, followed by spaces in between if you want to pull the data on multiple stocks at once. Have fun!

## Recent Updates

I'm currently trying to make it so that you're able to query multiple stocks at once. For now the interface will be through the command line until I work out all the functionality. After which, I'll start building the GUI.


## Development

Any pull requests and comments are entirely welcome! It still needs quite a bit of setting up. After you've cloned this repository, run `npm install`, followed by `npm start` to get it running. You will need a local instance of PostgreSQL to have this up and running.
