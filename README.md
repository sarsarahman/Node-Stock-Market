# Stock Portfolio

This is a project that serves as a platform to build a stock market portfolio and track stocks. It's currently being worked on. 

## Usage

First clone this repository and run `npm install`, follwed by `npm start` to start it up. After that, just enter a stock symbol, followed by spaces in between to pull data on multiple stocks at once. Have fun!

## Recent Updates

Functionality to query multiple stocks at once is in the works. For now the interface will be through the command line until more functionality is worked out. After which, the construction of the GUI will commence.

## Development

Any pull requests and comments are entirely welcome! It still needs quite a bit of setting up. First clone this repository, then run `npm install`, followed by `npm start` to get it running. A local instance of PostgreSQL is required to have this up and running along with a local PostgreSQL username and database name set up beforehand.

For PostgreSQL set up instructions with Knex.js, refer to http://knexjs.org/
